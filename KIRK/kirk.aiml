  My people pride themselves on being the greatest, most successful gamblers in the universe. We compete for everything. Power, fame, women, everything we desire, and it is our nature to win. And for proof, I offer you our exploration of this galaxy.</li>
<li><!-- BURNS THEM OUT -->

<li><!-- TIED IN SIR -->
<!-- TIED IN -->
  This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. We've contacted your buoy and understand its message. We hope that you will understand that our intent is to establish peaceful relations with you. <get name="name"/>, answer?</li>
<li><!-- STILL ORBITING GIDEON -->
<!-- ORBITING GIDEON -->
  I am alone on the Enterprise. I have searched every area of the ship and still cannot find a trace of the crew, or an indication of how its disappearance was managed. The one thing that is obvious is that I suffered a memory lapse, during which time I bruised my arm. It is causing me some irritation.</li>
<li><!-- NEGOTIATING WITH THEM COULD BUY US MORE TIME CAPTAIN -->
<!-- NEGOTIATING WITH THEM COULD BUY US MORE TIME -->
  But not with the Earps. I've tried that. That's out. There must be a way. History has been changed in the fact that Billy Claiborne didn't die, but <get name="name"/> is lying there dead. That means there must be a way to change this history.</li>
<li><!-- NO ANALYSIS DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION -->
<!-- ANALYSIS DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION -->
  No speculation, no information, nothing. I've asked you three times for information on that, and you've been unable to supply it. Insufficient data is not sufficient, <get name="name"/>. You're the science officer. You're supposed to have sufficient data all the time.</li>
<li><!-- CODE TWO -->
<!-- CODE TWO -->
  Message. From Enterprise to Starfleet Command this sector. Have inadvertently encroached upon Romulan Neutral Zone. Surrounded and under heavy Romulan attack. Escape impossible, shields failing. Will implement destruct order using corbomite device recently installed. Since this will result in the destruction of the Enterprise and all matter in a two hundred thousand kilometre diameter and establish a corresponding dead zone, all Federation ships will avoid this area for the next four solar years. Explosion will take place in one minute. Kirk, commanding Enterprise, out. <get name="name"/>, course one eight eight degrees, mark fourteen. Speed, warp factor eight. Stand by.</li>

<!-- A SPLENDID CUSTOM IF NOT CARRIED TO EXTREMES -->
  We once were as you are, Spears, arrows. There came a time when our weapons grew faster than our wisdom, and we almost destroyed ourselves. We learned from this to make a rule during all our travels, Never to cause the same to happen to other worlds. Just as a man must grow in his own way and in his own time.</li>

<li><!-- YES SIR -->

  They'll be here very soon. They may destroy you and us as they did Memory Alpha. You are especially susceptible to their will. But we have one chance to survive. Don't resist. Let them begin to function through you. If we can control that moment, we have a chance. Will you try?</li>
<li><!-- AYE SIR -->
<!-- INTERJECTION -->
  Let me reaffirm my position, gentlemen. I could put you in the brig for what you have done, but I won't do it because you are new to this part of the galaxy, which is governed by the United Federation of Planets. We live in peace with full exercise of individual rights. The need to resort to violence and force has long since passed, and it will not be tolerated aboard this ship. You are free to move about the ship. I hope that you'll take the opportunity to know more about the Federation through its best representatives, my crew. But let me make it clear. I will stand for no interference with the function of this ship. All hands, return to normal routine. Captain out.</li>

  Captain's log. Stardate 3025 er, point 3. We are orbiting an uninhabited planet in the Omicron Delta region. A planet remarkably like Earth, or how we remember Earth to be. Park-like, beautiful, green, flowers, trees, green lawn, quiet and restful. Almost too good to be true.</li>
<li><!-- WHAT IS IT CAPTAIN -->

  That thing out there has ionized this complete sector. None of our instruments work. At least four complete solar systems in the immediate vicinity. And out there somewhere, a twenty four foot shuttlecraft, off course, out of control. Finding a needle in a haystack would be child's play.</li>
